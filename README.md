# Enable Packman Repository on openSUSE Tumbleweed

After a fresh install of openSUSE Tumbleweed, some media content (such as videos in Firefox) may not play properly due to missing proprietary codecs. This is a common issue that can be resolved by enabling the **Packman** repository and switching the relevant packages to it.

This guide provides the necessary commands to enable Packman and perform a vendor switch to ensure proper multimedia support.
